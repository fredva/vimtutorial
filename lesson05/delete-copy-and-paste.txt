Lesson 05.

# Delete yank (copy) and paste

This lesson is about removing something and putting it elsewere.

Tasks begin here:
-----------------

Task 01: Delete a line of text and put it somewere else
-------------------------------------------------------
To delete a piece of text, we use the 'd' command or in this case 'dd' to delete a whole line. This places the text in one of VIMs registers (or clipboard if you like).
The 'p' command puts the content of the register after the cursor position. The 'P' command puts the content of the register *before* the cursor position.
Try to reorder the following lines using 'dd' and 'p'. Also try to do the same with 'dd' and 'P'.

Task 02: Duplicating lines
--------------------------
To yank a piece of text, we use the 'y' command.
By itself it does not do anything useful, but if we give it a motion to play with we can do interesting things.
As you might have seen on other commands, doubling the command will make it operate on the line as a whole. Duplicate the following line a couple of times. What happens if you 'yy' and then press 'p' multiple times? What happens when you give 'p' a multiplier, for example '33p'

Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name.

Task 03: (Almost) all that is removed ends in the register.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Most of VIMs delete-commands does put the deleted content in a register. In this task we will quickly change the order of two letters. With the cursor positioned at the misplaced character press 'xp' to change the order of the letters. Remeber 'x' deletes the character under the cursor.

I'm here at an awesome VMI-workshop at NCD.

Task 04: Registers from a to z (literaly)
-----------------------------------------
One of the more powerful features of VIM is the named registers, VIM has 26 of them and they are named 'a' through 'z'. To yank or delete a line into a named register
we prefix the yank or delete command with '"' and the name of the register. Example: To yank the current line into register 'a' we would type '"ayy"'. If you instead
want to delete the line you would issue '"add'. To paste the contents of a register we just prefix the appropriate put-command with the register name: '"ap'.

Equipped with this deadly and powerful weapon, proceed to the task at hand.


Yank this line into register 'a' without removing it.
Delete this line and put the contents in register 'b'.
Paste the contents of register 'a' beneath this line.
Paste the contents of register 'b' above this line (no cheating).

Bonus task!

Yank this line and the line under it without using visual mode, and paste it somewhere.
(since we assume no prior VIM experience, you probably don't have a clue about how to enter visual mode anyway)

Task 05: Inspector gadget.
--------------------------
VIM lets you inspect the contents of the different registers with the ':reg' command. Try it now.
Do you see the contents of the named registers? What about the registers from 0-9 you may ask. This is a stack containing all the 10 latest pieces of text
that has been 'd'eleted or 'c'hanged. Try it out now with some various commands and inspect the register afterwards to see what effect the different commands
have on the contents of the registers. Can you figure out what the name of the anonymous register is (the one that gets populated when you do a regular 'yy')?
