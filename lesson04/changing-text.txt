Lesson 04.

# Changing text.

Now I expect that you master movements, insertions and deletions.

Now we will look into deleting and entering insert-mode at the same time.

For this we will use the 'c'. (For change).
The change-command will delete text and simultaneously enter insert-mode.

Change is good.

Tasks begin here:
-----------------


Task01: Change a word.

Unsurprisingly the change-command is dependent of a corresponding movement command.
To change a word, stand at the beginning of a word and press 'cw'.
If you are positioned at the end of a word, use the 'cb'-command.
Change the misspelled word on the next line.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Hello word.

Task02: Change a whole line

If you issue the double 'c', aka 'cc' you will change the whole line.
Change the following line to something more reasonable.

Well, I guess that I just should go to my nearest electronics shop and buy an android phone.

Task03:

Try some of these commands if you like. They are based on the same principle as the delete commands from the previous lesson.


cc: change the current line.
c$ or D: change from current posittion to the end of the line.
cG: change from current positionto the end of the document.
cgg: change from current position to the start of the document
cw: change from current position forward one word.
cb: change from current position backward one word.
c15G: change from current position to line 15.


While playing with change-commands on the next few lines, you should undo the changes afterwards.

* Change this line.

* Change from - to the end of the line.

* Change from any position in this line to the beginning of the document.

* Change from any position in this line to the end of the document.

* Change multiple lines using 'd49G'.

Prepare for the next chapter, then you will learn how to use text-objects.
