Lesson 08

# Macros

Macros are at the heart of VIM, this is an advanced topic, so dont
be alarmed if you don't master these techniques at once.

Macros record a sequence of keystrokes, and can be executed afterwards an
arbitrary number of times.

A quick example.

Say that we wanted to record a macro for 'delete inner word'.
This is what we had to type.
- 'qa' 'q' to start recording macro, and 'a' to put it in macro register 'a'
- 'diw' to delete inner word
- 'q' to stop recording
- to execute the macro, we would issue '@a' (execute macro in register 'a').



Raiders of The Last Task(tm).
-----------------------------

Below is a list of strings that represent various javascript files.
Can you create a macro that wraps those strings in a <script>-tag?

E.g. this:
js/jquery.js
Should become this:
<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>



js/jquery.js
js/underscore.js
js/backbone.js
js/obscure.js
js/app.js
