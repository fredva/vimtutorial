Lesson 06.

# Visual mode, the most visual mode #

This lesson is about visually select chunks of text using VIMs Visual mode.
Visual mode gives you an intuitive method to select and act upon selections.

Onward to the tasks.

Task 01: Select with visual mode
--------------------------------
To start a visual selection, make sure you're in normal mode (press "Esc") and hit
the 'v'-key.
You now have entered visual mode and you can start selecting text by navigating the cursor (with h/j/k/l).

Try it now.


Task 02: Use movements
----------------------
When in visual-mode you can also issue other movement-commands.

Try to select *these three words* by entering visual-mode and use the 'w'-key (maybe with a multiplier).

You can also issue go-commands, e.g. '15G' (go to line 15), 'gg' (top of document), and 'G' (go to end of document). Play around a bit.

Task 03: Yank, delete and put
-------------------------------
The yank, delete and put commands do also work in visual-mode. Try them out!

Yank some of this text,
And put it below this line: ____


Task 04: Select linewise
------------------------
To more quickly select larger portions of text we can use a special visual-mode called Visual-line.
Surprisingly it selects one line at a time, visually.
Enter visual-line mode by issuing 'V'.
Try to use visual-line, delete and put to re-order the following lines.

3. Third
1. First
2. Second
4. Fourth

Task 05: Block select
---------------------
But wait, there is more special visual modes. Now we will get on with a mode called visual-block.
This mode enables you to draw a rectangle on the screen and select text. Hard to imagine? Try this:
- navigate down to the table
- position the cursor at the beginning of the table header
- enter visual-block-mode by pressint 'C-v' (thats Ctrl-v).
- press '4l' and '5j'.
- now you can try to press 'd' to delete this column. Nice?

 id | name | occupation |
-------------------------
 01 | Jon  | Nurse      |
 02 | Jan  | Programmer |
 02 | Geir | Superhero  |
 02 | Tor  | Musician   |


Task 06: Winning with block select pt. 1
----------------------------------------
Let us say that you have a piece of Javascript code that you want to comment out.
- navigate to the first line of code
- enter visual block mode
- press '3j', 'I', '//' and then Escape. Nice? (if you screw up, remember to undo with 'u')

console.log("hello");
alert("world");
console.log("bye");
alert("cruel world");

Task 07: Winning with block select pt. 2
----------------------------------------
Let us take the piece of code from the last task, but now let us imagine that
we have been writing Coffeescript or ruby for a long time, and we have forgotten
to add semicolons at the end of each line.
- navigate to the first line of code, and go to the end of the line with '$'
- enter visual block mode
- press '3j', 'A', ';' and then Escape. Nice?

console.log("hello")
alert("world")
console.log("bye")
alert("cruel world")
