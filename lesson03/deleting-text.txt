Lesson 03.

# Deleting text.

Sometimes you say or write the wrong things. More often, other people say or write the wrong things. 
This lesson is about removing stuff.

Tasks begin here:

Task01: Deleting characters

You can delete the character under the current cursor using 'x'.

Task02: Deleting more than one character at the time

Many commands accept a multiplier, for example the 'x' can be made to delete an arbitrary number of charachers.
Delete the extra characters by issuing '2x' on the appropriate places. Remember, you can undo the changes by pressing 'u'.

Task03: Deleting, now with movements.

If you must delete more than one character at a time, the 'd' command is what you are looking for.
By itself it does not do much, but when issued with a movement, you can literaly change the world (or at least the current document).
